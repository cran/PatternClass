\title{
Class-focused pattern metric comparisons
}
\description{
Permits the estimation of composition and configuration parameters from a binary landscape map (provided as a numeric matrix).  These values are then used to simulate a series of statistically similar maps from which a suite of class-focused pattern metrics are computed and stored to produce empirical (null) distributions for each pattern metric.  The package also produces probabilities and allows the testing of whether metric values measured for a map could have been produced by random chance.  Numerous graphic outputs are also produced to facilitate the analysis and comparison of spatial patterns at the class-focus.
