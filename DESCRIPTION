Description: NOTE: This content is being migrated to the package ShapePattern to provide a comprehensive set of tools for shape and pattern analysis. All future maintenance will be in that package -- please update your links. This current package provides tools for estimating composition and configuration parameters from a categorical (binary) landscape map (grid) and then simulates a selected number of statistically similar landscapes.  Class-focused pattern metrics are computed for each simulated map to produce empirical distributions against which statistical comparisons can be made. The code permits the analysis of single maps or pairs of maps.  Current limitation is for binary (classes 1, 2) maps that are 64x64 cells in extent.
